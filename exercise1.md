I picked Python for this hypothetical CI setup task. Here' are the tools that were recommended by the community for setting up CI within a team of 6 people:

For checking and cleaning up the code, I'd go with flake8 or pylint, because they seem to be the most thourough. They also very popular among the Python commnuity. For testing, I would choose pytest and unittest for their reliability and ease of use. For app building and automation, Jenkins, Buildbot, and tox, are libraries that came up a lot. As for alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI, the team could use CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, and GitLabâ€™s CI/CD tool, all offering great features for Python projects.

Would the setup be better on the cloud or in a self-hosted environment? If the project needs to be deployed before a specific date, I would choose cloud-based services. It would be easier and faster to set up and it would let us focus on getting the app shipped. Of course, we've got to think about the budget and security as well. A self-hosted server gives more control but needs more knowledge. However, a major advantage of self-hosting is that it's cheaper to maintain, with the added benefit of owning the data. So, if my team doesn't have the time to manage our servers, or lacks knowledge in self-hosting we might go with cloud services instead.
